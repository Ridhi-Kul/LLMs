This repository reflects how to work with LLMs. 

We also understand the difference between LM and LLMs. 
Then we move on to understanding Hugging face platform to use open source models. We see the Transformer library and understand Tokenizer. After training models, we evaluate and save them.

Now we will be moving onto understanding LangChain along with vector databases.
